# NeuroBehavioral Insights: Data Analysis of Behavioral Tests

## ðŸ§  Background & Motivation

Mental health disorders, particularly **anxiety** and **depression**, are widespread global challenges. Yet, despite their prevalence, understanding the neurobiological mechanisms driving these conditions remains a significant challenge. **Behavioral animal models** play a crucial role in preclinical research, enabling scientists to study **neurobehavioral responses** and evaluate the effects of potential therapeutic treatments.

This project focuses on analyzing **behavioral neuroscience data** from multiple well-established tests used to model anxiety and depression in animal models. These testsâ€”**Hole Board Test**, **Forced Swim Test (FST)**, and **Elevated Plus Maze (EPM)**â€”are critical in studying the effects of drugs, behavioral changes, and other interventions.

The primary motivation for this analysis is to transform experimental data into **meaningful visual insights**, which can aid in **drug discovery** and **neuroscientific research**.

## ðŸ§¬ Key Tests Conducted

### 1. **Hole Board Test**
- **Purpose**: Measures exploratory behavior, which is often inversely related to anxiety. 
- **Metric**: Number of head dips into holes on a board.
- **Insight**: The `Standard` group showed the highest head dipping, indicating lower anxiety and higher exploratory behavior. The `Sample1` and `Control` groups showed lower activity, suggesting anxiety-like responses.

### 2. **Forced Swim Test (FST)**
- **Purpose**: Evaluates depressive-like behavior by measuring how long animals remain immobile during forced swimming.
- **Metric**: Time spent immobile in water.
- **Insight**: The `Control` group showed the longest immobility, indicative of depressive-like behavior. Conversely, the `Standard` and `Sample2` groups showed significantly reduced immobility, indicating potential antidepressant effects.

### 3. **Elevated Plus Maze (EPM)**
- **Purpose**: Assesses anxiety by analyzing how much time an animal spends exploring open vs. closed arms.
- **Metrics**:
  - Percentage of entries into the open arms.
  - Time spent in the open arms.
- **Insight**: The `Standard` group spent the most time in the open arms, suggesting anxiolytic effects. The `Control` group showed less exploration, indicating anxiety-like behavior.

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

The following metrics were visualized using **bar charts with error bars (SEM)**:

1. **Hole Board Test**: Shows exploratory behavior (anxiety-like traits).
2. **Forced Swim Test**: Analyzes immobility time to gauge depressive-like behavior.
3. **Elevated Plus Maze**: Assesses anxiety by comparing open-arm exploration.
